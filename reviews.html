          <p>The best dentist in the valley. Definitely is not in it just to make money. I had many dentist in the valley tell me I had cavities that really did not exist. Dr. Ericksen found one cavity and made sure to show me the cavity on the screen with a small camera because he knew I have had a hard time trusting dentist in the area. I am from a small town in California and he gives off the caring small town vibe. Highly reccomend going to him for your dental needs!

          <p>I want to let you know that I was very pleased and satisfied with the results of my most recent visit to Ericksen Dental. The dental work to be done was fully explained and I felt very much at ease during the entire visit. I am very happy and confident to recommend Ericksen Dental to anyone needing dental work.

          Thank you.

          <p>I felt so comfortable going to Ericksen dental office! I really appreciated the patience and care that was exemplified by all the staff and Dr Ericksen.   Anxiety, fear, money and actually embarrassment has kept me from getting and maintaining dental health.  But you showed me that it's is not to late to get my smile and teeth so I can rebuild my confidence.  Again, thank you! And I look forward to hopefully having you for my dentist in future!
