        <p>“The physical need and suffering in these rural communities is great,” says David. “Coming from a land of plenty with modern conveniences, it’s remarkable to note the contrast between their physical health needs and the health of their hearts. </p>
        <p>Last month Dr. Argyle and his family were able to go down to Guatemala and provided free dental work for many of the children and teenagers who normally don’t have an opportunity to visit the dentist. We had a wonderful time providing service as we fell in love with a beautiful country with even a more beautiful people. </p>

        <p>Access to basic healthcare is a luxury for millions of refugees, so I was pleasantly surprised to hear about a group of dental surgeons offering much-needed relief to those in Greece and Calais. It is hard enough to bear toothache at the best of times; what about if you are a refugee?</p>
    
        <p>To find out more about the work of the dentists, I asked Dr Munir Ravalia, one of the volunteers, how he got involved; what kind of dental health problems has he encountered in the refugee camps; how are they organised; and why did he feel compelled to provide his services?</p>

        <p>The extent of the problem was set out by fellow health professionals in the camps in Calais and Lesvos. Dr Ravalia, who is based in London, told me that over 25 per cent — and sometimes more than 40 per cent — of acute medical cases found amongst refugees are related to dental care. Tooth decay is one of the most common health problems worldwide, so the figure of 40 per cent was not surprising, as people are usually susceptible to this throughout their lifetime. According to Ravalia, assessments in Beirut and its suburbs have also found that 65 per cent of Syrian refugee patients there suffer most commonly from dental problems and influenza.</p>

        <p>Like so many of his colleagues in other medical professions, the depressing condition faced by refugees prompted Dr Ravalia and others like him to offer their skills to a group of dental surgeons led by Dr Ola Hassan in Calais. He said that Dr Hassan dedicated her time to providing emergency dental care to Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan refugees. The Health Point Dental Foundation, of which she is part, provides relief to thousands of desperate refugees across a number of camp sites.</p>
